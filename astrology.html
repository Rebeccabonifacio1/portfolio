              <h1> What is Astrology?</h1>
              <h3> Astrology is the idea that the stars and planetary positions play a role in human affairs and events. Astrology has been dated as far back to the 2nd millennium BCE and was a core component of ancient civilizations and cultures. <b>Astrology argues that the placement of the planet’s positions during one’s time of birth plays a large role in that individual’s character and potential achievements or struggles in their life. </b>Beyond this, one’s birth chart can interact with present day placements to help explain challenges that an individual or the world could be going through. </h3>
              <br> 
              <h2> <b>  Ultimately, people use astrology for one of the following reasons:</b></h2>

            <h3>Astrology is built off of 12 signs that each represent a 20 day birth cycle. These signs materilize differently for each individual, but can help to explain certain tendencies and personality traits. These signs are located in both planets and houses. Each sign is located in one of the eight planets in our solar system and one of twelve houses. <b>Both planets and houses have different meanings and characteristics behind them, which can tie into understanding a person or situation in relation to their sign’s location in one of these placements. </b></h3>

        <h3> Astrology is a personal journey, therefore, the best way to truly experience it is to do your own research. However, if you’re not ready to dive in yet, it would be best to look at how astrology has predicted past events. <b>Astrology has the power to answer a number of questions about yourself and the world, you can get assurance about the future, learn about your current situation, future decisions, and feel connected to the universe thanks to astrology. </b></h3>

    <h3> As mentioned above, astrology has been an important part of culture, dating as far back as BC. Astrology has been used by historical figures, such as kings and popes, and previous presidents of the United States like Benjamin Franklin and Ronald Reagan. There is a reason this practice has remained instilled in society; it provides accurate insights on people’s personas, the way in which they interact with one another, and can help predict world events. Hearing about another person’s experience with the craft may not be enough to convince you to take the dive into astrology. <b>Everyone’s experience with astrology is different, but when you take the time to truly learn about it, you  may be surprised by its accuracy. </b></h3>

      <h1> Signs </h1>
      <h3> When people think of astrology, they typically think of their sun sign. Sun signs are one of 12 zodiacs that get assigned to an individual depending on when they were born. The first sign of the zodiac, Aries, begins on March 20 and goes until April 19. This reoccurring monthly cycle repeats throughout the year, with Pisces being the last sign of the zodiac, staring on February 18 and going until March 19.<b> While your sun sign is an important part of your persona, everyone is made up of more than just this one placement.</b> Upon calculating your birth chart, you’ll discover that you have a sign for every planetary placement, as well as a rising sign, or an ascendant, which changes depending on your birth time. </h3>
        <br>
 <h3> While each sign represents different ideals and personality traits, signs are grouped together based on the elements. <b>Fire signs,</b> Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, are known for being <b> passionate, exuberant and feisty.</b> <b>Earth signs,</b> Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn are typically <b>grounded, practical and hard-working. Air Signs,</b> Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, are <b>unique, intellectual and curious.</b> Finally, <b> water signs,</b> Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces, are known for being <b>intuitive, emotional and dreamy.</b> The more elemental placements you have in your chart, the more likely it is for this element to dictate your persona, same as having a lot of placements in one specific sign. </h3>
        <br>
     <h3> Signs are the most intricate aspect of astrology, so <b>it’s okay if you don’t relate to all the traits and characteristics people with these sign placements typically hold. </b> Below you will find a brief description of the makeup of each zodiac sign, starting with Aries. This is merely an introduction and it’s highly encouraged to do some more extensive research off of your  specific sign placements if you’d like to learn more. </h3>

    <h1> Planets </h1>
        <h3> Just as important as signs, is the concept of planets. The makeup of a birth chart is dependent on planetary positions - each of us have one of the above 12 signs in every planet. Signs stay in certain planets for years, such as Pluto, that changes every 10 years, or can change as quickly as every two days like the moon. In addition to the 8 planets in our solar system and the sun and the moon, every person has a rising sign. Your rising sign, or ascendant, changes every two hours and is essentially the makeup of your being, often times defining how others perceive you. <b> Although your rising sign is not based off of a planet, it holds the same weight as the other planetary positions, making it just as vastly important for understanding astrology. </b></h3>
    <br>
        <h3> Similarly to the signs listed above, the planets represent far more than listed below. Consider the below statements a broad overview of how these planets may affect your persona based on your birth chart. <b>Remember, the best way to get a true understanding of the planets in relation to you is to learn what sign is in each planet on your chart. It is through the characteristics of both the sign and the planet that you will discover the most about yourself </b></h3>

    <h1> Houses </h1>
        <h3> The last vital piece of information for understanding astrology is house placements. <b> Houses, listed from House 1, which is always placed in your rising sign, to House 12, each rule specific characteristics and traits similarly to planets and signs. </b>The position of a house will help you understand how a specific sign or planetary placement will manifest in your life and where it’s most likely for problems to arise in relation to these characteristics.</h3>
    <br>
        <h3> When a planet visits a house, they light up that part of your chart and energize the house’s traits. <b>Astrologers often use the houses to predict which parts of your life will come into focus, and where you can take the best possible action. </b>While it’s important to understand the basics of each house, it may be the easiest to comprehend by looking at your specific birth chart and which houses hold the most weight. <b>Lastly, while every person has a sign in every house, they don’t all hold the same weight, </b> so depending on which birth chart calculator you use, you may not see all the houses on your chart. This just means that that specific house/sign does not hold much weight over your persona and life path, but it is still vital to understanding the ins and outs of yourself.</h3>
    <br>
        <h3> Below you will find basic descriptors of each house to help you get accustomed with the concept. As with all parts of astrology, <b>these are merely summaries, </b>and it is likely that these can manifest differently in your life. If you’re interested in learning more, <b>it’s recommended to look up the house in relation to your specific sign and planetary placements to best understand how they interact. </b></h3>
